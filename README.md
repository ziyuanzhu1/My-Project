# My-Project

What is your website about?
One of my favorite would be listening to Electronic Dance Music(EDM)and going to raves/music festivals. EDM and rave culture is becoming more prevalent now because of the youth-oriented subculture that blends music, art and social ideals. My website is going to have a general overview of what EDM genre is, the culture of going to raves as well some fun photos of my personal experiences going to them. 

What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site be important?)

Who is your target audience?
My target audience would be people that are curious about EDM music and the rave community.

- Overview of EDM music (Different types of EDM genre)
- Overview of Raving
- Why are raves and EDM music so prominent in the Asian-American community?
- Personal Experiences (Including pictures)
- Song/Artist Recommendations
