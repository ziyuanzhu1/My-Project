    <h1>EDM Music</h1>
    <p>Since EDM is the umbrella term for everything produced electronically or made up of electronic components, 
        there are many different genres within EDM that each hold their own spot on the dance music spectrum. 
        Below, we break down the most popular genres within electronic dance music and offer a few examples of what these 
        styles of music sound like. Do keep in mind that the line between genres can be very thin and blurry, mostly 
        because a lot of artists love to innovate and combine elements from different genres.</p>

        <p>House is a music genre characterized by a repetitive four-on-the-floor beat and a typical tempo of 120 beats per minute.
            It is a direct descendant from disco music, rising to prominence in the late 70s and early 80s when the disco era ended.
            House tracks often use the Roland TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines; the term "house music" comes from the fact that these 
            machines allowed DJs to create tracks at home without the use of an expensive studio.
