    <h1>EDM Music</h1>
    <p>Since EDM is the umbrella term for everything produced electronically or made up of electronic components, 
        there are many different genres within EDM that each hold their own spot on the dance music spectrum. 
        Below, we break down the most popular genres within electronic dance music and offer a few examples of what these 
        styles of music sound like. Do keep in mind that the line between genres can be very thin and blurry, mostly 
        because a lot of artists love to innovate and combine elements from different genres.</p>
