    <div class="desc">One of my favorite memories was going to <em><strong>EDC Las Vegas</strong></em> with my Babson friends. It was my first time
        traveling across the country for a festival. Although the 3-day festival was tiring, I truly had one of the best times 
        since I was around music I loved!

    <div class="desc">Last year, my friends and I would often go to Boston for rave concerts. If not every week, we would go every two weeks! 
        One of the most memorable concerts would be bumping into one of my favorite DJs <strong>ARMNHMR</strong>. We were able to get pictures with them as well!

    <div class="desc">During my birthday weekend, my friends and I went clubbing since all of us were finally 21. Since we were all legal enough to attend
        a club, we even booked a table as well! One of my favorite DJs <strong>NGHTMRE</strong> played the night of at <em><strong>Royale Boston</strong></em>!.</div>

    <div class="desc">The first EDM festival I attended is <strong>Electric Zoo</strong>, which is located in New York. It was my first time attending an EDM festival with so many people!
        Even though many people got lost throughout the day, we all still had a fun night!
