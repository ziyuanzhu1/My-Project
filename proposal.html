    <h1>Ziyuan Zhu's Project Proposal</h1>
    <h2>What is your website about?</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite would be listening to Electronic Dance Music(EDM)and going to raves/music festivals. EDM and rave culture is becoming more prevalent now because of the youth-oriented subculture that blends music, art and social ideals. My website is going to have a general overview of what EDM genre is, the culture of going to raves as well some fun photos of my personal experiences going to them. I wanted
        to create this website because when I got started, it was difficult to navigate this community by myself. I would like this website to be a source of basic information that people can use if they are curious about EDM music and the rave community.

    <h2>Who is your target audience?</h2>
    <p>My target audience would be people that are curious about EDM music and the rave community.</p>

        <li>Overview of Raving</li>
