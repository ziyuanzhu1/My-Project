    <h1>Rave Culture</h1>
    <img src="images/culture.png" alt="Rave Culture" width="100%">
    <h3>Origin</h3>
    <p>Raves began to emerge in the 1980’s as secret dance parties that usually 
        happened after-hours in metropolitan cities. During these humble beginnings, 
        the philosophy of PLUR was created, which is still present to this day!</p>
    <h3>PLUR</h3>
    <p>PLUR stands for Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect; which are the core principles 
        that rave culture is based on. Raving and rave culture is all about celebrating 
        our love for dance, music, and self-expression! PLUR has become embedded in rave 
        culture and is the foundation of what raving culture is today. Raves have become 
        adopted by the mainstream culture and has evolved into something much greater 
        and inclusive than what it once was.</p>
    <h3>Clothing</h3>
    <p>Nowadays, rave outfits have become a big part of the festival experience. 
        Today fashion and rave wear varies with different fan based of sub-genre 
        and or particular festival branding to some attendes. Wearing what make 
        you feel you can express yourself is always a great idea to make those 
        few items as unqiue as you can. Whether you're a dubstep warrior with 
        the dark tones or a fairy queen with your fluffier or LED top, there is 
        always something for everyone to feel their best at a festival!  
        There’s no better way to do that than with clothing that’s reflects you!</p>
    <h3>Kandi</h3>
    <p>The idea of PLUR resonates strongly with all ravers and we celebrate it 
        by engaging in the ritual of trading kandi. Kandi are colorful bead 
        bracelets that often have little messages or charms and although these
        are really cute, they represent something more than just a bracelet. 
        Each piece of kandi that you trade comes with a story and marks a 
        special moment you shared with someone during the night. To trade 
        kandi with another raver, you each engage in a special handshake that 
        is accompanied by the mantra, “Peace, Love, Unity, Respect.”</p>
